# Data Analytics Portfolio
Hello! I'm Josh and I'm a data analyst. I've been working in the tech field for over 10 years as a developer and tech manager before transitioning to data analytics. I've worked on everything from API connections to content management systems.  Currently, I spend my time in Microsoft Power BI, Tableau and Metabase. I am also skilled in Excel and Google Sheets. Thanks in part to my background in development, I am very proficient in SQL and can also code in Python. I have more than 10 years experience with PHP and have used it to build online data reporting tools.

I became a full-time data analyst after an employer requested that I analyze an order flow for an eCommerce website. I had developed the order flow but had not previously been in charge of analyzing its strengths and weaknesses. An outside marketing firm had created a data analysis for the order flow. I observed that it had left out key pieces of data-- it failed to recognize that many users were being dropped into the middle of the order flow and conclusions were being drawn as if all users started at the beginning of the order flow. I was able to discover this oversight and prevent company decisions beind made based on incomplete data.
